# Predicting the Daily Rainfall in New South Wales

A data science project to be completed in fulfillment of the DSCI 525: Web and Cloud Computing course at the University of British Columbia.

Our goal is to develop an ensemble model capable of predicting the amount of rainfall in New South Wales, an eastern state located in Australia. Features of the data include outputs of different climate models, which will be learned and compared to observed rainfall measures to gauge performance. We aim to deploy the final model via the cloud such that it is available for public use.

## Dataset

The "Daily Rainfall over NSW, Australia" dataset can be found on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681) (~6 GB).
