    "> Welcome to milestone 3. [This video](https://ubc.zoom.us/rec/share/KwmxGenbxzGXbj3-bTqm0dCG2kdF3TrJcZ8hSXadZIRxY6g62XAEihrbInXCmUj1.VyfFpvC4kK57X--A?startTime=1681063172000) ( Passcode: `w.0bp@d8` ), gives you an introduction to this milestone. I usually do this in the lab, but I thought to make this video as this week will be a busy and short week for you folks, and you can work on this anytime based on your comfort. Due for milestone 3 is only with Milestone 4, so you can also look into it with Milestone 4. Some more details will be given in the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Milestone 3:*** This milestone aims to set up your Spark cluster and develop your machine learning model to deploy it in the cloud for the next milestone. In the next milestone, you will be deploying your model in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better split the workload, I have decided to divide the milestone into 3 parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Part 1:*** You will set up your EMR Spark cluster based on the configurations for your need. You will be asked to provide some screenshots to demonstrate that you have successfully set up your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Part 2:*** You will develop your machine learning model in scikit-learn to deploy it in the cloud for the next milestone. This is completely decoupled from the cluster setup, and you can develop it on your laptop, which will be easier for you. A Python 3 notebook named `Milestone3-task3.ipynb` is provided in the Milestone3 folder, which you can use to develop your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Part 3:*** You will use Spark's MLlib to obtain the best hyperparameter settings for your model using the cluster you set up in Part 1. A Python notebook named `Milestone3-task4.ipynb` is provided in the Milestone3 folder, which you can use to develop and obtain the best hyperparameter settings.\n",

    "\n",
    "- _Please use the Firefox browser for this milestone and ensure that you have set up Foxy Proxy._\n",

    "- _All services you use are located in the `us-west-2` region._\n",
    "\n",
    "- _If explicit instructions are not provided, use only the default VPC and subnet, and leave all other options as default when setting up your cluster._\n",
    "\n",
    "- _When providing a screenshot, please mask any visible IP addresses before uploading it._\n",
    "\n",
    "- _For your Spark MLlib process, a 1-node cluster with a single master node (and zero slave nodes) of size m5.4xlarge is good enough (m5.xlarge is sufficient if you are in short of money). These configurations may take 15-20 minutes to optimize tuning parameters for the entire dataset._\n",
    "\n",
    "- _In the event of an issue, if you need to spin up another EMR cluster, be sure to terminate the previous one._\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Upon termination of the cluster, all stored data will be lost. Please ensure that you save any data to S3 and download the notebooks to your laptop. This will enable you to upload the notebook to a different cluster when using JupyterHub next time._\n",
    "\n",
    "_***Outside of Milestone [OPTIONAL]:***  you are encouraged to practice spinning up EMR clusters._\n",
    "\n",
    "***VERY IMPORTANT:*** With Task 4 (Question 4), remember to occasionally download the notebook to your local computer. Once the lab is stopped after three hours, your EMR cluster will be terminated, and everything will be erased. While notebooks will be saved in your S3 bucket, it's good if you download them locally as a backup in case you haven't configured your S3 bucket properly."
