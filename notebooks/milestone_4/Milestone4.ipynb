    "Once your API (the question above is done) we're ready to deploy it! For this, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup an EC2 instance. Make sure you add a rule in security group (of your EC2 instance) to accept `All TCP` connections from `Anywhere`. After that SSH into your EC2 instance.\n",
    "2. Make a file `app.py` file in your instance and copy what you developed in Question 1 in there. \n",
    "\n",
    "    2.1 You can use the Linux editor using ```vi```. More details on vi Editor [here](https://www.guru99.com/the-vi-editor.html). Use your previous learnings, notes, mini videos, etc. You can copy code from your jupyter and paste it into `app.py`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.2 (OPTIONAL WAY) Or else you can make a file in your laptop called app.py and copy it over to your EC2 instance using ```scp```. Eg: ```scp -r -i \"ggeorgeAD.pem\" ~/Desktop/app.py  ubuntu@ec2-xxx.ca-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:~/```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Download your model from s3 to your EC2 instance. You want to configure your AWS CLI and S3 for this. Use your previous learnings, notes, mini videos, etc.\n",
    "4. Install the dependencies of your API, like `flask`, `joblib`, `sklearn`, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.1. (Additional help) you can install the required packages inside your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Install packages (there might be others): \n",
    "            pip install flask scikit-learn joblib\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Now you're ready to start your service, go ahead and run `flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080`. This will make your service available at your EC2 instance's `Public IPv4 address` on port 8080. Please ensure that you run this from where ```app.py``` and ```model.joblib``` reside.\n",
    "6. You can now access your service by typing your EC2 instances `public IPv4 address` append with `:8080` into a browser, so something like `http://Public IPv4 address:8080`. From step 4, you might notice that flask output saying \"Running on http://XXXX:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\", where XXXX is `Private IPv4 address`, and you want to replace it with the `Public IPv4 address`\n",
    "7. You should use `curl` to send a post request to your service to make sure it's working as expected.\n",
    ">EG: curl -X POST http://your_EC2_public_ip:8080/predict -d '{\"data\":[1,2,3,4,53,11,22,37,41,53,11,24,31,44,53,11,22,35,42,53,12,23,31,42,53]}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Now, what happens if you exit your connection with the EC2 instance? Can you still reach your service? You won't be able to, because the `flask` process will shut down when you exit your shell session. This is because `flask` is running in the foreground, and when you exit your shell session, the process is killed. We need to run `flask` in the background so that it persists even after we exit our shell session.\n",
    "9. We could use several options to help us persist our server even after we exit our shell session. We'll be using `screen`. `screen` will allow us to create a separate session within which we can run `flask` and won't shut down when we exit the main shell session. Read [this](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/) to learn more on ```screen```.\n",
    "10. Now, create a new `screen` session (think of this as a new, separate shell), using: `screen -S myapi`. If you want to list already created sessions do ```screen -list```. If you want to get into an existing ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "11. Within that session, start up your flask app. You can then exit the session by pressing `Ctrl + A then press D`. Here you are detaching the session, once you log back into EC2 instance you can attach it using ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "12. Feel free to exit your connection with the EC2 instance now and try reaccessing your service with `curl`. You should find that the service has now persisted!\n",

    "#### Discussion of our Journey :')\n",
    "\n",
    "This project presented multiple challenges and learnings. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Milestone 1 we were taught first hand how difficult it can be to load big data locally, and how our typical data file formats start to present challenges. We also had firsthand experience with the difficulties of transferring data across python and R, and how arrow exchange improved the experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Milestone 2, we had a lot of experience learning how to configure (via AWS) an EC2 instance, and an S3 bucket for storage. We used these tools to move our parquet file into the S3 bucket, and save as a csv after some wrangling. We discovered that this was a much easier and more streamlined process for dealing with large datasets, as the wrangling and processing was much quicker on the cloud when starting with a parquet file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Milestone 3 we experimented with a distributed EMR instance, and were able to understand how quickly it was able to handle complex hyperparameter tuning. Hyperparameter tuning is typically quite a slow process, so knowledge of outsourcing this to the cloud is invaluable. Being able to save model/results to the S3 bucket is also a helpful skill. Milestone 3 is really where we started to develop our intuition for cloud computing, as the benefits became very clear seeing how effective hyperparameter optimization could be. Wranging is one thing, but this was impressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Milestone 4, we learned how helpful cloud deployment can be for reproducibility and communication of modeling results. It’s difficult to notebook or a script to someone to communicate your results, but with a cloud deployment it’s much easier to share our results. Flask is a very versatile program, and will be a very useful tool for us in the future."
